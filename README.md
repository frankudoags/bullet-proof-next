# Bulletproof Next.js + Jest + TailwindCSS

This is a bulletproof starter template for building a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
Tailwind for styling, Jest for testing, Typescript for type checking and code safety,
 and Next.js for everything else. Very ease to use
